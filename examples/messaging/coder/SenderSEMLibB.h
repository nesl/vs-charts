   * Status code:     SES_ACTIVE.
   *
   * Explanation:     The completion code has one of the two expositions:
   *                  1)  A state/event deduction is started, while an event
   *                      inquiry is active. All inquired events have not been
   *                      returned by the function SEM_GetInput.
   *                  2)  An event inquiry is started, while a state/event
   *                      deduction is active. All deduced action expressions 
   *                      have not been returned by the function SEM_GetOutput 
   *                      and the SEM_NextState has not been called in order to 
   *                      complete the state/event deduction.
   *
   * Solution:        The completion code is a warning and perhaps the
   *                  application program should be rewritten. An event inquiry
   *                  and a state/event deduction should not be active at the
   *                  same time.

   * Explanation:     You are making a reference to an identifier that does not
   *                  exist. Note that the first index number is 0. If the 
   *                  VS System has 4 identifiers of the same type and you use a
   *                  function with the variable parameter = 4, the function 
   *                  will return an SES_RANGE_ERR error. In this case the 
   *                  highest variable index number is 3.
   *
   * Solution:        The application program will check the index parameters 
   *                  with one of the following symbols defined in the SEMBDef.h

 *                  internal current state vector and the rules in the

 *                  All action expressions are deduced by continuously calling 
 *                  the function SEM_GetOutput or one call to the
 *                  SEM_GetOutputAll function.
 *                  Before calling the SEM_Deduct function again, the
 *                  SEM_NextState or SEM_NextStateChg must be called to

 *                  The function will be auto generated by the VS Coder during
